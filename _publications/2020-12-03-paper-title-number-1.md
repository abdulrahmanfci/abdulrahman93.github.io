excerpt: 'â€”Abstract: Stock market trading is a complex process where
traders aim to maximize their expected return while minimizing
associated risks. With the increasing availability of digital
historical records, using automated agents for stock market
trading becomes of a significant interest. Reinforcement learning
is a machine learning branch which circumvents the problem
of defining explicit targets and tackles problems which require
sequential decisions. Reinforcement learning has been applied
in finance problems, yet execution costs optimization problem
among others still gets little attention. The optimization of
execution costs in stock markets is a vital problem, where a
trader wants to minimize the cost of buying a predefined amount
of shares over a fixed time horizon. In this study, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning Q-trade model to address the
execution costs optimization problem. We tested the Q-trade
model using historical data of the Egyptian stock market and
Nasdaq stock market, and it showed in both markets a significant
improvement (more than 60% for some securities) over the
compared strategies.
