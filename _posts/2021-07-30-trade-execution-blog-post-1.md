This post will be about explaining the paper (under construction). <br> <br>
This post is built on the paper "Optimizing stock market execution costs using reinforcement learning" [link](http://abdulrahman93.github.io/files/Optimizing-stock-Ahmed.pdf).

What is trade execution?
======
Trade execution is the completing of a purchase (or sale) of previously specified amount on a specified timeframe. For example, consider you asked your broker to buy 1000 shares by the end of the week, the broker can buy them all today or part today and part next day. At the end the broker has a lot of options but had to buy exactly 1000 shares abd by the end if the week the 1000 shares must have been bought.


How can reinforcement learning help in this?
