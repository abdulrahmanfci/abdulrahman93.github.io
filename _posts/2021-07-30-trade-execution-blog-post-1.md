This post will be about explaining the paper (under construction). <br> <br>
This post is built on the paper "Optimizing stock market execution costs using reinforcement learning" [link](http://abdulrahman93.github.io/files/Optimizing-stock-Ahmed.pdf).

What is trade execution?
======
Trade execution is the completing of a purchase (or sale) of previously specified amount on a specified timeframe. For example, consider you asked your broker to buy 1000 shares by the end of the week, the broker can buy them all today or part today and part next day. At the end the broker has a lot of options but had to buy exactly 1000 shares abd by the end if the week the 1000 shares must have been bought.


How can reinforcement learning help in this?

What is reinforcement learning?
------

Reinforcement learning is the branch of machine learning that concerned with learning the agent by reward. Supervised learning defines a label and penalize the model for not choosing the correct label, while in unsupervised learning the concern is to discover the hidden relations and patterns. Reinforcement leanring trains the agent by a reward value (signal) which the agent can infer from it after a number of steps what is a good or a bad move. For example, if an agent designed to to buy a share, and the reward was the amount of money spend on buying that share the agent will learn after a number of steps that buying the share at lower price is much better (in reward term) than buying the share at higher price.
