Hello! This is Abdulrahman, a PhD student in Industrial Engineering dept. at the university of Pittsburgh. I'm doing research on developing methods that can sample efficiently from larg-scale simulations to estimate their treatment effects. Previously, I was a TA and MSc student at faculty of computers and information - Cairo university. My research in MSc was about how to utilize reinforcement learning in optimzing execution costs(a financial problem).
