Hello! This is Abdulrahman, a PhD student at the university of Pittsburgh. I'm doing research on developing methods that can sample efficiently from a larg-scale simulations to estimate their treatment effects. Previously, I was TA and master's student at faculty of computers and information - Cairo university. My research in MSc was about how to utilize reinforcement learning in optimzing execution costs(a financial problem).
